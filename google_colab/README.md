## IPython Notebooks (.ipynb)

**Google Colab (or Google Colaboratory)** is a cloud-based platform hosted by Google Research that allows anyone to write and execute Python code in a notebook environment directly through a web browser.
A key feature is that Colab requires no setup while providing free access to computational resources, including GPUs, to encourage research in machine learning, data analysis, and education.

## How to Open IPython Notebook from GitHub
1. Go to the [Google Colab Platform](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Under `Open notebook`, select the `Github`
3. Enter the following link in `Enter a GitHub URL or search by organisation or user`:
```
https://github.com/lpmor22/docs/new/main/ipynb
```
4. Click `search`, and after a brief scan, you will see a list of available notebooks on GitHub

**Note: notebooks opened directly from GitHub will not be saved automatically, so you must save a copy to your personal Drive.**
